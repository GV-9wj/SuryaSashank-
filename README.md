#### A little bit about myself
- I am a 21 year old mechanical engineer who wishes to pursue a career in computational finance. I currenly work as a technical analysis intern at a trading firm. I'm new here to the programming community but I am a fast learner. Would love to work on any finance projects or open source contributions. Please contact me at the links in the pages down below.

**1.** I am currently working on building a financial analysis tool with R programming

**2.** I am currently learning **C++ and Technical Analysis**

**3.** All of my projects can be found here at [My repositories](https://github.com/suryasashankgundepudi?tab=repositories)

**4.** Ask me anything about Python, R, Statistical Data Analysis, Technical Analysis, Portfolio Management and Probability theory.


#### Some of my projects are listed below

1. **Flight Delay Prediction:** During my time at the Solarillion Foundation as a Research Assistant I developed a two stage machine learning model after data wrangling that predicts the time, in minutes, by which a flight will arrive late or not. You can find the project [here](https://github.com/suryasashankgundepudi/Flight_Delay_Prediction)

2. **Credit Risk analysis and Predictive Modelling** : To expand my programming skills I implemented various R functions to bring about a report on the german credit data, which contains information about people who have taken loans and have either defaulted or paid them duely. You can find the project's source code [here](https://github.com/suryasashankgundepudi/credit-risk-analysis-and-predictive-modelling)

3. **My first Web Application using Shiny:** Within this project I try to implement some of the basic concepts of R programming and data visualization with R. I also wanted to explore the Shiny package in R, which led me to make an interactive visualization of the movement of the Collatz Conjecture. Source code can be found [here](https://github.com/suryasashankgundepudi/my-first-shiny-app)
